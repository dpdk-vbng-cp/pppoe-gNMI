# pppoe-gNMI
A gRPC/gNMI API for the pppoe dataplane.

## Dependencies
- make
- https://github.com/openconfig/ygot

## Generate protobufs
Apply patch to "fix" the bbf-pppoe yang model. The proto generator ygot
currently does not support all yang fetaures (e.g. bits). Therefore this patch
comments out section that can not be generated by ygot. The required patch can
be applied by:

```
make patch
```

To revert the patch:

```
make unpatch
```

To generate the proto files simply run make:

```
make
```

Proto files are generated in `proto/bbf-pppoe`.
